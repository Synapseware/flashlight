## about
Uses 2xAA batteries and two boost circuits: A 3.3V constant voltage boost circuit which powers a 30mA constant current LED driver board.  Probably not the most efficient design but I wanted to make a dual-boost circuit to power this simple flashlight at high and constant brightness.  Could switch out the LED for higher current model (probably 50-80mA max).

## board
* Dimensions are 15mm x 25 mm
*  LED is normal 2 lead type, white, mounted on the trace side with the pin soldered sideways
* Center of LED is about center of the board, so 12.5mm in
* Constant-voltage boost circuit is an SP6641A-3.3V.
* Constant-current boost circuit is LM3410X.
