## about
Uses 2xAA batteries and two boost circuits: A 3.3V constant voltage boost circuit which powers a 30mA constant current LED driver board.  Probably not the most efficient design but I wanted to make a dual-boost circuit to power this simple flashlight at high and constant brightness.  Could switch out the LED for higher current model (probably 50-80mA max).
